ObjectMemoryHandler
Author: Nate Kelley
C++17

This program was written as an assignment in c++ to learn more about memory handling and 
how some of the default functions work. The main and MyObject files were provided for the 
assignment and I implemented the pool file.

The class Pool is meant for heap management on a class by class basis. Using the strengths 
of C++ memory management you can improve efficiency in memory usage by reducing the amount
overhead that is normal when using the default 'new' function.
